# How to use

- Currently requires that `gh` (the github cli) is in `PATH` and authenticated for rust-lang access.
- It is recommend you build in `--release` mode unless you don't mind the runtime.
- Downloading all the log files may take awhile.
- The logs are cached so they'll only have to be downloaded once.
- At the moment this writes both the cache and the report to the current directory.
  This should be fixed in the future.
